The tool we used for reversing the plug's application binary was JADx by sky-Iot. The command for downloading this tool is the following:  
```  
jadx-gui homemate.apk  
```  
We then had to navigate to ***SecurityAes.java*** located in ***homateap.orbivo.com.securitylibrary*** package. In here, we found multiple methods 
relating to the application's security. The actual code for these methods was stored in the native library ***libHomeMate_Security.so*** and it was 
located whithin both ***lib/armeabi*** and ***lib/x86*** directories. To find these, we extracted the application binary by using:  
```  
$ unzip HomeMate.apk -d homemate  
$ cd homemate/lib/armeabi/  
$ 1s libHomeMate_Security.so  
```  
We used Binary Ninja's Cloud Version to start reverse engineering the extracted file we obtained from the previous step. Binary Ninja provided us with 
a list of functions that were contained inside this file, but we only need to analyze the one called ***Java_homateap_orvibo_com_securitylibrary_SecurityAes_encryptByteKey***.
Using Binary Ninja's *disassembly* on this function gave us access to the code and information stored inside it. Once inside, we had to look for an *add* 
operation that was associated with the variable **pkKey@GOT**. We then cliked on this variable so that it could take us to its definition. Once we were 
there, we looked for the identifier **pkKey** and extracted its memory address associated to it, which, in our case, was 0000655c. After getting the address
we enabled the *Strings view* in Binary Ninja to allow us to see the encryption key stored in that memory address.
